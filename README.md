# GraphQL Test Project

This project looks at how a basic implementation of Graphql can handle HTTP requests. 

It can get and add new authors and books to a database. For this instance it is all in JS as I didnt want to create a Postgres DB and deploy. 

The code follows this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQL7tL2S0oQ)

Im sold on GraphQL! Such a great implementation of HTTP requests that are powerful and much better than a RESTful implementation
